Cool it worked thanks. Nikki1993,
so what i did is sudo npm cache clean
and then deleted all folders from ~/.atom/.apm
and there was no directory named .npm so i created it and the
executed the command sudo apm install script
and this time output is Installing script to /home/nobodyu/.atom/packages âœ“


npm cache clean --force 
npm cache verify
