so for working with collaborators and repository changes
git fetch  git pull
2---
two head 
a head master that forwaard with acreate commit and show  last commit
a head that origin/master  that last commit origin stop 
view the  remote branch  our local repository knows about  â–¶git branch -r [referense ]  remote branch
remote tracking branch a bookmark that holds the spot the most recently known state of the master branch on origin
refs head  example  book    and demonstae with bookmark
3--
git status  
your branch is a head of origin/main by 1 commit    this sentanse   orgin head a commit latter than local ref_head 
you can checkout these remote branch pointer â–¶git checkout origin/master  âœ…i will  deatched  dont panicâœ…
when push local change   origin pointer commnucated  and update own 
4---
four total branch in repo  i will copy that url on main selected  and â–¶git clone url
when â–¶git status   âœ…on main branch  what is other branches? â–¶ git branch    no see another branch  but  github was another branch altough this
  actually not bad at all    but doesa not mean all my workspace at once
when type  â–¶git branch -r    we see all branch are in github
git own  automaticlly  connected  ref master with origin/maaster    and  check commit  head of this commit how many?
how make another branch  and connected to other branch on github?
we see  â–¶git branch -r    and  with â–¶git switch name_branch âœ…âœ…   origin/name_branch ðŸ“—git connected this branch to remote origin/name_branch
note  git search name_branch  in remon branch name  if this name existed  swhitch on branch Otherwise show fetal error this branch not existed
old way doing this  replace â–¶git switch name_branch =  â–¶git checkout --track origin/name_branch
very useful command â–¶git switch name_branch_remote  when collige request check this branch and you say i have not this 
branch with super easy command  â–¶git switch name_brach  can have that branch
5---
you clone  and work on project  some commit  and diverge between origin remote with ref head  behind  collabrator push 
and change remote repo  teammate has pushed up change to the master branch but my  loacal repo doesnt know
this is where the two command we are going to discuss fetching aand pulling or git fetch ,git pull
ðŸ”¼ðŸ”¼up ward âœ…âœ…ðŸ“—workspace â–¶(git add) staging(index) â–¶(git commit) local repository â–¶(git push)remote repository 
so that down ward ðŸ”½ðŸ”½ðŸ”½   remote repository â–¶  (git fetch)local repositoryâ–¶(git pull)work space
git fetch  >> think of it as "please go and get the latest information from github but dont scew up my working directory"
â–¶git fetch <remote> if we can specifically just fetch one branch  â–¶git fetch <remote> <branch>
if lost internet i would still have acces to all of the work as of this momment in time 
6--
execise
create new file on github accunt with ascii art  
when â–¶git status   message on branch fantesy your branch is up date with origin/fantesy
 âœ…just mean im up to date with what my local repo knows not what it exactly is at this one moment in time 
because it can change my repo is not constantly asking hey this or new stuff i do that i tell you  
i waant to get the changes taht say my friend told me what i say bob head  told me Colt just aadded to movies branch 
go fetch them â–¶ git fetch remote branch then ðŸŒ¿ðŸ“—message  your branch is behind origin/fantesy
git make a branch parallel with local branch and dont change current branch you can check with â–¶git checkout origin/fantesy  
 doing detach head !! using  fetch the latest information about some remote repository it just doesnt automaticly
integrated changes into whatever your working on  
7---
git pull
w ecan use to retrieve changes from a remote repoitory  but big deffrence is that poll will actually update our head branch
it change working directory    fit pull =git fetch+git merge  
 â–¶git pull remote  branch   then origin/fantesy and  fantesy head exact same
8--
handle conflict  if pull what collabrator change smae thing
pull can result merege conflict 
some time get a fast forard merging so pretty smoth some time automaticlly some time conflict
   â›”â›”better before push up changes  first time pull down  that see changes
for conflict  first time  to spisific file conflict  and add stage  then commit
if push  on github  wouldnt be on github resolve conflict
9--
shorter syntax  
im not going to pull some other branch onto the food branch 
if you run fit pull without specifying a particular remote or branch to pull from 
fit assume the following  remote will default to origin â–¶git pull
branch will default to whaatever tracking connection is configured for your current branch
when â–¶git switch movies     origin/movies        git automaticaly  git push   figure out that  is origin movies
git fetch update remote tracking branch 
â›”â›”â›”not recommend if you have uncommitted changes use git pull
