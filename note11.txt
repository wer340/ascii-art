 public repo  is accessible    it diascoverable 
thats  still does not mean people can change the contents of repository âœ…  that cant push to repository
they haave to collabrative privieges or premission to do do that
when private   who can see    who have been granted access  they have been added as collabrator
different organization  or enterprise  level github  where  a private âœ…repo visible to everyone within the organsion
but we working with personal free account  so a private repo  âœ…is only visible to me  the owner and people i specifically acces grant
for  change repo   public  to private    setting    down page  danger zone   change visiblity
